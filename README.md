        Site looks amazing, home page buttons work as they should. I did notice that the number fields in asking questions and greater less then break if you put anything other then numbers. That is on the back-end so it would require you to mess with it as it seems like it might be a data validation issue. Everything looks good on mobile, no issues I could find other then the ones from before. All in all its a good looking site with only a few issues I could find. Good Job Dude.
